## Overview

This project is an age calculator project that allows you input a date and get the age in years, months and days

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

This project is built with Semantic HTML, CSS and Javascript. A form element was used in the html page and each div in it had a label and an input Javascript was used to add functionality

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- javascript

### What I learned

Some of the things i learnt while working on this project include working with the date object. i had to create a couple of date object to work it out

### Continued development

In the nearest future from the time of publishing this i hope to animate the process of the age appearance
